# Weave Reminders

This is a permaweb app that allows users to safely store and receive reminders for future events. 

Once mined in the arweave blockchain, the reminders are securely stored in the permaweb and can only be accessed via the user's arweave wallet. 

This therefore means a user can store confidential information in these reminders without few of their privacy being compromised and since arweave is decentralized, this also means the risk of losing this information in the future is non-existent.


# Usage

1. Clone this repo and from its root run the following two commands,
-`yarn install` to install the required dependencies
-`yarn serve` to run the permaweb app.
